== 1. Converting the images to a usable format for the algorithm: ==

To run, place the files found on the image server in the local directory. 
Depending on which dataset is being used, run either ConvertImages1.m (for 
the GEv730_LinearArray folder) or ConvertImages2.m (for the 
SonixRP_LinearArray folder). Change the 'Path' variable to point to the 
directory containing the images to be modified. Run.

For reference, here are the directories on the image server:
/data/shared/data/BeamwidthData/GEv730_LinearArray
/data/shared/data/BeamwidthData/SonixRP_LinearArray

== 2. Running the algorithm: ==

Open houghAlgo1.m (for GEv730_LinearArray) or houghAlgo2.m (for 
SonixRP_LinearArray). Change the Path variable to match the directory 
where the images are stored (should be the same as above). Run. 
A figure window should be displaying segmented lines and selected lines.



== Known Issues/Notes: ==
- It is difficult to test this algorithm with noisy data, since no 
  ground truth is known
- the SonixRP_LinearArray line detector will occasionally pick up 
  vertical lines perpendicular to what is expected. The cause for 
  this is currently unknown. It should be noted that segmentations 
  for this especially noisy data seem to be generally not very 
  reliable.
