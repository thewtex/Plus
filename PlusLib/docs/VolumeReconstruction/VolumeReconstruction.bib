	This is reverse-tri-linear interpolation. A single pixel is distributed

	This is implemented in our software, though reconstructions do not
	turn out as nice when we apply hole-filling with this, possibly because
	of unequal weighting.
	
	The last few paragraphs of 2.1 are interesting: they use the same
	ultrasound resolutions as us, but claim that hole-less is easy to
	accomplish. This isn't an RBF but could be with a larger kernel (not
	too sure about this last point, reread later?)},

	"Although a real-time visualization based on raw B-scans (without

	(Prager et al. 1999) and, despite the existence of efforts of authors
	(Treece et al. 1999, 2000, 2001) to do signal processing directly
	on the raw data, a regular grid is still needed to apply further
	processing with off-the-shelf algorithms."
	
	
	Uses the same error metrics as us (MAE and visual assessment)
	
	The data preparation method is different (Artificially removing data
	vs. removing input slices)
	
	
	Uses a modified Gaussian convolution filter based on Meirs et al (2000).
	They use the variance of the surrounding voxels, but I do not understand
	the intuition behind this, nor do I see any explanation in the paper.
	
	
	The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel is always done such
	that 98.76% of the data is kept. See Trucci.
	
	
	Gaussian convolution is shown to not perform as well on larger holes,
	but performs very well on small holes.
	
	VNN exaggerates resolution perhaps? If so, then that is where our
	algorithm performs better - it is less sensitive to outliers because

  abstract = {Freehand 3D ultrasound is increasingly being introduced in the clinic
	for diagnostics and image-assisted interventions. Various algorithms
	exist for combining 2D images of regular ultrasound probes to 3D
	volumes, being either voxel-, pixel- or function-based. Previously,
	the most commonly used input to 3D ultrasound reconstruction has
	been digitized analog video. However, recent scanners that offer
	access to digital image frames exist, either as processed or unprocessed
	data. To our knowledge, no comparison has been performed to determine
	which data source gives the best reconstruction quality. In the present
	study we compared both reconstruction algorithms and data sources
	using novel comparison methods for detecting potential differences
	in image quality of the reconstructed volumes. The ultrasound scanner
	used in this study was the Sonix RP from Ultrasonix Medical Corp
	(Richmond, Canada), a scanner that allow third party access to unprocessed
	and processed digital data. The ultrasound probe used was the L14-5/38
	linear probe. The assessment is based on a number of image criteria:
	detectability of wire targets, spatial resolution, detectability
	of small barely visible structures, subjective tissue image quality,
	and volume geometry. In addition we have also performed the more
	"traditional" comparison of reconstructed volumes by removing a percentage
	of the input data. By using these evaluation methods and data from
	the specific scanner, the results showed that the processed video
	performed better than the digital scan-line data, digital video being
	better than analog video. Furthermore, the results showed that the
	choice of video source was more important than the choice of tested
	reconstruction algorithms.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) is increasingly being introduced
	in the clinic, both for diagnostics and image guidance. Although
	dedicated 3D US probes exist, 3D US can also be acquired with the
	still frequently used two-dimensional (2D) US probes. Obtaining 3D
	volumes with 2D US probes is a two-step process. First, a positioning
	sensor must be attached to the probe; second, a reconstruction of
	a 3D volume can be performed into a regular voxel grid. Various algorithms
	have been used for performing 3D reconstruction based on 2D images.
	Up till now, a complete overview of the algorithms, the way they
	work and their benefits and drawbacks due to various applications
	has been missing. The lack of an overview is made clear by confusions
	about algorithm and group names in the existing literature. This
	article is a review aimed at explaining and categorizing the various
	algorithms into groups, according to algorithm implementation. The
	algorithms are compared based on published data and our own laboratory
	results. Positive and practical uses of the various algorithms for
	different applications are discussed, with a focus on image guidance.},
